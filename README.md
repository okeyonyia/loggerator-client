### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Docker: Follow the instructions for your operating system to download and install Docker.
Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository containing the application:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Replace yourusername and your-repository with the appropriate values.

Build the Docker Image
From the root directory of the repository, build the Docker image by running:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t your-image-name .
Replace your-image-name with a name for your Docker image.

This command will create a Docker image using the Dockerfile present in the repository's root directory.

Run the Docker Container
Now that the Docker image has been built, you can run a container using the image:

bash
Copy code
docker run --name your-container-name -p 8000:8000 your-image-name
Replace your-container-name with a name for your Docker container, and your-image-name with the name of the image you built in the previous step.

This command will start a Docker container that maps the host's port 8000 to the container's port 8000, which is the port the application should be running on.

Access the Application
With the Docker container running, you can now access the application by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

If you want to stop the container, you can do so by running:

bash
Copy code
docker stop your-container-name
Replace your-container-name with the name of the Docker container you specified earlier.
